# NFL Big Data Bowl 2025: Predictive Analytics Project

Welcome to the NFL Big Data Bowl 2025 Predictive Analytics Project! This project aims to use NFL player tracking data to generate insights into game dynamics, player performance, and team strategies through SQL queries, data visualizations, and analytics. This analysis provides valuable insights for coaches, analysts, and teams to enhance game strategies, player selection, and real-time decision-making.

## Project Overview

This project is structured to address the NFL Big Data Bowl competition on Kaggle, focusing on pre-snap to post-snap predictions. SQL queries are used to extract key data points from BigQuery, followed by Python-based visualizations to represent trends, patterns, and insights. Each visualization includes insights that highlight potential applications for NFL gameplay and strategic improvements.

## Project Structure

- **queries/**: SQL query files used to extract data from BigQuery for analysis.
- **visualizations/**: Python scripts that generate visualizations, with saved PNG files.
- **insights/**: Documentation on insights derived from each analysis.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions for running the analyses.
- **results/**: Combined output of query results and visualizations in PDF format for easy reference.

## Key Analyses and Visualizations

### 1. Game Summary: Home vs. Visitor Scores by Week
   - **Objective**: Analyze potential home-field advantage by comparing scores between home and visitor teams across weeks.
   - **Insight**: Patterns showing higher home scores may indicate advantages due to familiar environments, crowd support, or reduced travel fatigue. These findings can inform strategies, especially in playoff scenarios.

### 2. Top Players by Rushing Yards
   - **Objective**: Rank players by rushing yards to showcase top performers in rushing.
   - **Insight**: Recognizing top rushers helps teams optimize defensive strategies or offensive plays around these high-impact players.

### 3. Pass Completion Percentage by Team
   - **Objective**: Measure each team's passing efficiency based on completion percentages.
   - **Insight**: High pass completion rates reflect quarterback-receiver coordination, critical for offensive consistency.

### 4. Player Speed Analysis: Top Players by Max Speed
   - **Objective**: Identify high-speed players who can capitalize on breakaway plays.
   - **Insight**: High-speed players, like wide receivers, are critical for executing rapid movements in deep passes or defensive pursuits.

### 5. Average Yardage by Quarter
   - **Objective**: Track the average yardage to go per quarter.
   - **Insight**: Trends showing decreased yardage requirements may reveal strategic adaptations or defensive fatigue.
